## Brain Tree
My ever-growing Brain Tree! I put everything I want to here: especially stuff that would be cool to share instead of keeping private. My **digital garden** is a **wiki** specifically about my **learnings** and **what matters to me**. It's entirely possible that its structure could change drastically over time, as I grow.

### What stuff is found here? 
To determine what sort of notes I grow here, here are the criteria they must meet:
1. It's something I care about keeping information on, to the point of **true** understanding. This implies a certain level of pre-existing investment.
2. I feel that I would still like to think about it **in the future**, instead of serving a short-term goal.

### Content Guidelines
- I write in a way that **fits the way I think**. In terms of words chosen, general structure of notes, navigation.
- Basically: this is not going to end up reading properly like a book, it's going to be written in the way I want to write it.
- Notes are **always** in a state of incompletion. I personally don't care about noting status whether it be progress or certainty. For *my style*, status serves no value. One of the big positives for me is how every note has the **capacity for change**. 
- I do **not**, cannot, write notes in various PKM systems, styles, and belief: such as Zettelkasten, PARA, Second Brain, and more. **It's cool that it works for others**, but it is truly **not for me** because in my experience it results in [[Senseless Info Hoarding|senseless info hoarding]]. It creates too much friction because I simply do not think in the same way. I take what works and leave the rest, even if it means I end up taking only one idea from something. **It was never worth the cognitive load of creating notes to fit anyone else's system but my own.** This post ([Is the concept of Personal Knowledge Management flawed?](https://old.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/zkefis/is_the_concept_of_personal_knowledge_management/)) has similar thoughts I have towards such specifications. I *personally* do not like them because there is more value for me in finding what works for my brain. 


## The Author, Kuchai

I will put information about myself here when I feel like it. I'm quite shy and honestly embarrassed to talk about myself. I'm working on it!
