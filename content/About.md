## Brain Tree
I put everything I want to here: especially stuff that would be cool to share instead of keeping private.

### Writing Guidelines
- I write in a way that makes sense to me personally. In terms of words chosen, general structure of notes, navigation. Otherwise I would not be able to keep this up since I will be using these notes too!
- Notes are always in a state of incompletion. 
- While it is important for linking thoughts to have the ideas be as small as possible, there are *personal* limits to that as I dislike **too much** division of ideas.
- I do not, cannot, write notes in various PKM system styles such as Zettelkasten, PARA, Second Brain, etcetera. I have tried in the past; it creates too much friction to even use a different word than what I use in my brain. Even moreso changing the way I take notes to fit them: way too much cognitive load. I *personally* do not like them because there is more value for me in finding what works for my brain. 


## Me, Kuchai

I will put information about myself here when I feel like it. I'm quite shy and honestly embarrassed to talk about myself. I'm working on it!
