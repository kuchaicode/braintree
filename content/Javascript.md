> [!info] Definition
> A [[high-level programming language|high-level]] programming language, so it's accessible. Follows the [[ECMAScript]] standard. 
> Some key features: 
> Dynamic typing, Use of Prototypes for Objects, Functions can be Variables

## Info 

## Data: Numbers, Booleans, Strings

- Arithmetic operations: ` +, -, *, /, %`. Supports parenthesis `()` for priority-setting. 
- Boolean `true | false`
- Strings can be created with `'` or `"`
- Concatenation: `"Wow " + "that's crazy."` | `"Numbers 6, 7, " + 8 + 9` | `"Hi pls " + ["be in", "order", "!?"]`

## Logic 
- **"Not"** this, or check if **nonexistent** → `!false`, `!data` 
- Conditions:  `===`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Null
- Undefined → is a value, but it also means there's no other value
- Falsy → false, undefined, NaN, null, 0, "",  

## Objects


## Built-in Functions
- `.substring(0, 7);` → specified *section* of a string
- `.charAt(2);` → char in a string at particular pos
- `.length;` → length 



## Reminders 
- Statements are terminated with `;` but this is not strictly enforced. Do it anyway.
- `==` invokes type coercion.
- `"0"` is truthy.
- Not declaring a variable with `var` makes it declare globally.
