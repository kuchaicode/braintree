- *Javascript Syntax Extension*
- **HTML-like** syntax
	- When you're using [[Javascript]] put it in `{}` (ex: variables, ternaries)
	- Think of it as **both HTML and Javascript** together, just make sure the syntax is correct
- **className** to use classes
- can also have inline styles through **style**, but also why suffer
- Dynamic. Can have expressions, loops, conditionals.
- Each expression (ex: in a **return** statement) can only have **one** parent element, not multiple.
	- Which is why we can wrap multiple elements in either **fragments** `<> </>` or **divs** `<div></div>`
