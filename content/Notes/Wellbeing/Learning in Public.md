## *Learn* in public. *Build* in public. **(Insert verb here) in public.** 

All have the same concept. They all build on the fact that everyone starts from somewhere: everyone sucks at something first before eventually getting better at it. 

Be bad → Doing Things anyway despite being bad, in public → More opportunities for feedback and increased knowledge for future iterations of Doing Things → Faster/more iterations → Faster skill level up speed

Tl;dr? Quite literally: **Just do it.**
