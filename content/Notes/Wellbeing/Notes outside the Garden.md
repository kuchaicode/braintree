While there are many benefits to [[Digital Garden|digital gardening]], there are use cases where it is definitely not the best choice for certain notes. 

My own personal productivity system relies on proper segmentation of information of the different facets of my life. This is especially true for my system because I am a big fan of [[daily notes]] as a starting point for almost every note I create. But I wouldn't share such a thing in any public setting, because **everything** goes there. 

Not everything has benefits for being shared, especially in our current age of wanton immoral data scraping/**stealing**.
