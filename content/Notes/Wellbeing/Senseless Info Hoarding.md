If we were to take notes on **everything** about every subject that interested us, there would be no end to our notes. How atomic do we truly want our notes to be, and what level of granularity is worth it to us? That's a personal choice that varies per person.

Taking too much notes for the sake of completeness of coverage is a fruitless task and can lead to getting stuck in specific corners. It's more practical to start with small things that matter and grow that outwards.

A question to ask when unsure: *Does taking notes on this deepen my understanding in a way that matters to me personally?*
