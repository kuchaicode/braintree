> [!HINT] Welcome! ü™∑
> Welcome to my **digital garden**: the **Brain Tree**! It‚Äôs filled with a variety of topics that interest me, and you can explore it using the [[Map of the Brain Tree]]. 


> [!Caution] Reminders üôè
> Since I‚Äôm still figuring out the best way to take *linked notes*, you‚Äôll see the brain tree evolve as I learn what ways of learning works for *me*. If you're curious as to why things are structured in a certain way or want to see my methodology regarding this, check out the [[About]] page. **Thank you for stopping by!**

 
## Changelog üõ†Ô∏è
- Minor style changes! Still working on it, but it's getting there.
- Decided on the [[Map of the Brain Tree|map]] as a way to get a broad overview of things. I didn't want to rely solely on discovery-focused breadcrumb trail navigation, especially when it comes to simply finding a topic of interest.
