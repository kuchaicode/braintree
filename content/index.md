> Welcome to my digital garden: the Brain Tree! It’s filled with notes on a variety of topics that interest me, and you can explore it using the Guide notes. Since I’m still figuring out the best way to take notes with linked thoughts, you’ll see the brain tree evolve as I learn. Thank you for stopping by!
